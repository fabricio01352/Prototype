# Prototype
Review of prototype!

This pattern will allow the creation of clones of an instance of an object. Creating an instance might be expensive or complex some times, for this cases, we can use this pattern, we can "clone" a created instance and do more instances of it.

The Prototype pattern in Java is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype), rather than creating new instances from scratch. 
  This pattern is useful when creating objects is expensive or complex, and you want to avoid the overhead of constructing new instances every time.
